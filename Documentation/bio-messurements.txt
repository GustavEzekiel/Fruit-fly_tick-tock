In bacteria:
have revealed that
a characteristic transcription rate is tens of nucleotides per second.
Using 40 nucleotides/s, we estimate that the time to make
a typical transcript is roughly 25 s.

An
mRNA transcription rate of 20 min−1
and a decay rate of 0.67 min−1
molecule−1 were used

translation rate:
3 × 105 amino acids/s

The number of ribosomes at work on synthesizing these new
proteins is roughly 20,000, which implies that the rate per
ribosome is 15 amino acids/s, while the measured value is
25 amino acids incorporated per second. These numbers also
imply that the mean time to synthesize a typical protein is
roughly 20 s.

In regard to the mean life of the mesengers, these have a poisson distribution with a mean = 20 for geasts.
