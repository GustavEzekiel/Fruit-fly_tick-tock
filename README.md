## Introduction
Mathematical and statistical model of fruit fly core circadian clock molecules. The main purpuse of this modeling is to fit ODEs that represent circadian oscilation of mRNA levels of clock components over single-cell RNAseq (scRNA-seq) data of clock neurons. Looking for diferences in parameters of the model across different neuron clusters and conditions represented in the scRNA-seq data.
